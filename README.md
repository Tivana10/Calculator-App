This project is a GUI-based Basic Calculator developed in Java using Swing. 
It allows users to perform standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator features a clear and intuitive interface with a display field for input and output, and buttons for numbers, operations, and special functions. 
The layout of the buttons is defined in a JSON-style array, making it easy to modify or extend the interface. 
The calculator also handles edge cases such as division by zero and invalid inputs.

In addition to the basic operations, the calculator includes Clear (C) and Backspace (←) buttons to improve usability.
Users can easily correct mistakes or reset calculations without restarting the program.
The logic for arithmetic operations is separated into a dedicated Calculator class, following good programming practices.
This project demonstrates basic Java Swing GUI development, event handling, and object-oriented programming principles, making it a useful learning tool for beginners.
